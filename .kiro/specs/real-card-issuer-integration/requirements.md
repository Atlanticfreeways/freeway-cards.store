# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature integrates a real card issuer API (Marqeta or Stripe Issuing) to replace the current mock card generation system, enabling the Freeway Cards platform to issue actual Mastercard/Visa virtual cards for production use.

## Glossary

- **Card_Issuer_Service**: The external API service (Marqeta/Stripe Issuing) that provides real virtual card creation and management
- **Virtual_Card_System**: The Freeway Cards internal system that manages virtual card operations
- **Card_Program**: The configured card program with the issuer that defines card properties and limits
- **KYC_Status**: User verification status required for card issuance compliance
- **Card_Lifecycle**: The complete flow from card creation to deactivation
- **Webhook_Handler**: System component that processes real-time card transaction notifications

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a verified user, I want to create real virtual Mastercard/Visa cards, so that I can make actual online purchases with my funded balance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a verified user requests card creation, THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL integrate with Card_Issuer_Service to generate a real virtual card
2. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL validate user KYC_Status before allowing card creation
3. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL store real card credentials securely with PCI compliance
4. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL return card details (number, CVV, expiry) to the user interface
5. WHERE user has insufficient KYC verification, THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL reject card creation request

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a platform operator, I want real-time transaction processing, so that user purchases are processed immediately and balances are updated accurately.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a card transaction occurs, THE Card_Issuer_Service SHALL send transaction data via webhook
2. THE Webhook_Handler SHALL process transaction notifications within 5 seconds
3. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL update user balance and transaction history in real-time
4. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL enforce spending limits during transaction authorization
5. IF transaction exceeds available balance, THEN THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL decline the transaction

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manage my virtual cards (freeze/unfreeze, set limits), so that I can control my spending and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN user requests card status change, THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL update status via Card_Issuer_Service API
2. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL synchronize card status changes within 10 seconds
3. WHILE card is frozen, THE Card_Issuer_Service SHALL decline all transaction attempts
4. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL allow users to set custom spending limits per card
5. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL validate limit changes against compliance requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a compliance officer, I want transaction monitoring and fraud detection, so that the platform maintains regulatory compliance and security.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL log all card operations for audit compliance
2. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL implement fraud detection rules for suspicious transactions
3. WHEN suspicious activity is detected, THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL automatically freeze the card
4. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL generate compliance reports for regulatory review
5. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL maintain transaction data retention per regulatory requirements

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want card program management capabilities, so that I can configure card properties and monitor system performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL provide admin interface for Card_Program configuration
2. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL monitor Card_Issuer_Service API performance and availability
3. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL handle Card_Issuer_Service API failures gracefully with retry logic
4. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL provide real-time dashboard for card issuance metrics
5. THE Virtual_Card_System SHALL alert administrators of system issues or compliance violations
